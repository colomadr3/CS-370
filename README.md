    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    I created a deep Q-learning algorithm to train a pirate agent that will navigate a preset maze to find a treasure. 
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

        Computer scientists develop software and systems to benefit society. Their work helps to analyze and automate tasks to make them more efficient.
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

        First I analyze the problem and determine the solution. I figure out what needs to reach the solution. I break that down into simple easy to process step.
        I translate that into a computer language. Then I test and correct until I achieve the solution in a effective manner.
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

        I need to understand how the effects of AI and reinforcemnent training will have on society. I need to abide by ethical policies in place to ensure the end
        user and the organization is protected. Data collected and used should be done so ethically keeping the privacy of the users.
